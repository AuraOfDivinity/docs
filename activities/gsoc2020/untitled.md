# GSOC 2020 Ideas

**Welcome to our Google Summer Of Code 2020 ideas page. As a student, you are welcome to pick any of the ideas listed below and start early in the community bonding process as well as learning a bit about our code if we get selected as a mentoring organization. And of course, we'd love you to stay around even if we are not invited to GSoC or if we cannot invite you as a student.**

Students can connect with the Org Admins and Mentors through various communication channels given below:

* **Email:** [**Jaskirat SIngh**](mailto:juskirat2000@gmail.com) and [**Devesh Verma**](mailto:deveshverma619@gmail.com) **\(Org Admins\)**

  Students and Mentors can join these discussion portals in order to carry discussions about their projects and interaction within community. 

* **SLACK Discussion platform:** [**Join to interact with community!**](http://slack.codeuino.org)
* **Community Contact Email:** [gsoc@codeuino.org](mailto:gsoc@codeuino.org)

All tasks on this page already indicate mentors for the task. New tasks on this page should be added only by those with the experience and time to invest in mentoring new developers.

**Make sure to Check out** [**Google Summer of Code 2019 with Codeuino**](https://docs.codeuino.org/documentation/activities/gsoc2020) **to know more about community participation in GSOC 2020.**

### 1.\) Development of Admin Management mechanism for DONUT

**Priority:** High

**Description:**  [Donut Platform](https://github.com/codeuino/Social-Platform-Donut) is a  flexible open source **Social Network Kit that aims** to give you the customized social network, social intranet or huge social enterprise application for communities that really fits their needs.

Development of configuration mechanism is one of our newest additions to our installation frameworks of Donut Platform.  Currently Donut is central hosted but aims to get bundled as FOSS/OSS tool. So, the task of this major project is to develop an **Admin Management System** that will allow individuals or community admins to setup for themselves. To simplify the configuration, these predefined modules will have the most common use cases with different options for modules and settings while setting up this environment.Few have been described below which would serve essential features as a separate modules:
