### Priority:

High

### Description:

#### Tasks:

* [ ] Build the UI of the bot.
* [ ] Bot should respond based on pre defined commands:
  * [ ] Todo commands:
    * [ ] View all items in todo
    * [ ] Add an item to todo list
    * [ ] Remove an item from todo
    * [ ] Mark an item to done

#### **Detailed Info:**

This bot is to be built as an independent module which will be integrated into Donut platform. Making it as an independent module will help us make this available to anyone willing to integrate this bot into there website/platform. 

#### **Working:**

Upon integrating this with Donut user should be able to use this bot upon clicking the bot icon on the lower right corner of the screen.

Upon clicking on the icon the bot should present user the commands that user can use in order to get a task done. For the beginning we are going ahead with TODO functionality. So when the bot interface opens users should be able to see 4 commands that will be viewing all the todos, adding a new to the list, removing a todo, marking todo as done. Clicking on each one of them should preform the desired task. 

If deadline of a particular todo is approaching the bot window should open automatically and send user a message saying the deadline is today or tomorrow.
