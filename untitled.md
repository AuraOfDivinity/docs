# Google-Summer-Of-Code-2019

## **Welcome to the Google Summer of Code 2019**

[**Google Summer of Code**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) is a global program which encourages university students aged 18 or over to participate with open source projects during their summer vacations from schools and gain exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits by drilling up their skills.

Google awards stipends, to all successful students who complete their free and open-source projects under [**Codeuino**](http://www.codeuino.org/). Alongside Codeuino community members volunteer as "mentors" to students, who assist them about their summer projects and succeed their projects in an expected way.

To learn more about this year's event and how GSoC works, please refer to the [**Frequently Asked Question \(FAQ\)**](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

**We had applied to Google Summer of Code 2019, accepted organizations were announced on February 26. Though we could not make to it as an independent organisation but was able to participate as a sub organisation under "**[**JBOSS Community**](https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/GSoC2019Ideas#jive_content_id_Category_Codeuino)**" where they vouched for us.** 

**We had many** [**project ideas**](https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/GSoC2019Ideas#jive_content_id_Category_Codeuino) **posted, and we welcome potential students and mentors to reach out to us for further involvement.**

## **About Codeuino**

[**Codeuino**](http://www.codeuino.org) is a volunteer-driven non-profit open source Social networking organisation that provides various robust frameworks solutions which could span the entire world through building all kinds of social environments, discussion portals and collaboration platforms, giving prospectus to various other organisations, users and outreachers to use social media in a custom way.

[**DONUT**](https://github.com/codeuino/Social-Platform-Donut) is a major project of [**Codeuino**](http://www.codeuino.org) that builds social networking Kit for various organisations to build up social environment \(like [**Facebook**](http://www.facebook.com)**,**[**Twitter**](http://www.twitter.com),etc\) for their organisation as well as for users to experience FOSS social environment and to showcase their productivity and services for their community along with the collaboration platform to interact with one another. This project stands similar to **"**[**Facebook**](https://facebook.com)**"**, **"**[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com)**"** like social medias.

The community is a group of young open source contributors creatively leveraging our expertise in social networking and development projects to improve the quality of outreaching, interaction and collaboration for the people in developing nations. Everyone at Codeuino contributes to increase efficiency, outreaching for the user and expedite idea generation for social networking.

If you are looking for a project which incorporates structured data and social networking medias then check out our [**project ideas page**](https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/GSoC2019Ideas#jive_content_id_Category_Codeuino) we had in 2019 and contact us though any communication channel described here.

## **Involving as a Student**

If you are a student, you can start exploring project ideas towards the GSoC application phase. Each project contains contacts to reach out to potential mentors, and many projects have also been listed with some ongoing issues. Students are requested to get involved with the community in order to carry with projects.

If you're an aspiring student for GSOC 2019 with Codeuino have a look at the following:

* [**Learn about GSOC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code)
* [**GSOC 2019 project ideas**](https://github.com/codeuino/GSOC/wiki/GSOC-2019-Ideas)
* Go through the [**GSOC Manual**](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) by Google
* **\[\[GSOC 2019 Student Application Template\]\]**
* **Interaction with Community by ''Introducing Yourself''**

Students can also [**propose their own ideas**](https://github.com/codeuino/GSOC/wiki/GSOC-2019-Ideas) that they want to include within the community

## **Involving as a Mentor**

Potential mentors are invited to assign themselves on the projects they want to mentor this summer under Codeuino community.

Mentoring takes about 5 to 6 hours of work per week \(more at the start, less at the end\). In return, a student works on your project full time for 3 months. Think about the projects that youâ€™ve always wanted to do but could not find the time.

Consider proposing your own ideas that match the community project style.

Make sure you get through the followings:

* Have read [**Mentoring Guide**](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/)
* Have read [**Mentors responsibilities**](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/responsibilities#mentors_responsibilities)
* [**Assigned projects**](https://github.com/codeuino/GSOC/wiki/GSOC-2019-Ideas)
