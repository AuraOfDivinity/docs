# GSOC Student-Application-Template

We will select the best proposals based on the following criteria: \(The quantity of students depends on the number of Codeuino projects accepted in GSoC\).

* The quality of the proposal and its priority for its various projects.
* Engagement of the student with the community and potential mentors.
* Contributions by the student to the Project & Community.
* Contributing to other Open Source Projects is a bonus.

## **Student Application guide**

* Student proposals should be very specific and high priority based. We want to see evidence that you can succeed in the selected project. Applications with one-liners and general descriptions definitely won’t be encouraged.
* Students have to provide appropriate/actual contacts. The work done during GSoC requires some discipline as you have to plan your day-to-day activity by yourself. Nevertheless, you can expect regular contact with your mentors both via the usual means of communication for your project as well as personal guidance via email, chat or phone conferences.
* Describe the things as impressively as you can, including your demonstrations during community contributions.
* If you are unsure whether your proposal is suitable, feel free to discuss it on our various following discussions portals:
* **SLACK Discussion platform:** [**Join to interact with community!**](https://join.slack.com/t/codeuino/shared_invite/enQtMzcxOTQwNzE4NzcxLWEyNzUxYjI0ZThiNWUyYWI5MzJlMTNmODMxN2NjMTcxODJkZmFhNTVkYmUyOTQ1YzgzNTlmMTVkYzVhMzdmNTQ)
* **Email:** [**gsoc@codeuino.org**](mailto:gsoc@codeuino.org)\*\*\*\*

We have many community members on our mailing list who will quickly answer any of your questions regarding the project. Mentors are also constantly monitoring the mailing list. Don’t hesitate to ask questions. We’d love to help you out!

## **Proposal Requirements**

The proposal will be submitted via the Google Summer Of Code website at [**https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) . We expect your application to be in the range of 1000-1200 words. Anything less than that will probably not contain enough information for us to determine whether or not you are the right person for the job.

Your proposal should contain at least the following information, but feel free to include anything that you think is:

### **About Yourself**

* Your Full Name
* Your Email Address
* Your Slack Username
* Your IRC Username
* Your Country
* What is your primary language? \(We have volunteers including mentors who speak multiple languages and can match you with one of them if you'd prefer.\)
* Where are you located, and what hours do you tend to work? \(We also try to match mentors by general time zone if possible.\)
* Your hangouts handle \(with preferable time you are available to talk\)
* Have you participated in an open-source project before? If so, please send us URLs to your profile pages for those projects or some other demonstration of the work that you have done in open-source. If not, why do you want to work on an open-source project this summer with Codeuino?

### **About Your Project**

* Name of your project.
* Detailed description of your idea including an explanation on why it is innovative \(maybe you already have a prototype?\), what contribution do you expect to make to the Codeuino community and why do you think your project is needed. A rough plan of your development and possible architecture sketches, giving some UIs.
* Why do they need it?, What technologies \(programming languages, etc.\) will you be using?
* What is the timeline for development of your project? The Summer of Code work period is 7 weeks long, tell us what you will be working on each week. \(As the summer goes on, you and your mentor will adjust your schedule, but it's good to have a plan at the beginning so you have an idea of where you're headed.\) Note that you should probably plan to have something "working and 90% done" by the midterm evaluation \(July 6-13\); the last steps always take longer than you think, and we will consider canceling projects which are not mostly working by then.
* Describe the working of your planned timelines.
* Detail the timeline explaining what the expected progress is for each week or every two weeks \(pay special attention to the milestones within the GSoC timeline itself, of course\) and how we should validate the results.
* Convince us, that you will be able to successfully complete your project in the timeline you have described. This is usually where people describe their past experiences, credentials, prior projects, schoolwork, and that sort of thing, but be creative. Link to prior work or other resources as relevant.

### **Community Interaction**

* What will you do if you get stuck on your project and your mentor isn't around?
* How do you propose you will be keeping the community informed of your progress and any problems or questions you might have over the course of the project?
* Mention your planned absences. We don't need you to detail what you will be doing when you are not working of course, but if you are going away for any reason we need to know so we don't think you've abandoned.
* Describe a great learning experience you had while working with your project.
* If you apply to more than one GSoC project, especially if you also apply for a project in another organization, specify which project you prefer. In case two organizations choose to accept your applications, we can then give you the project that is most important to you. Preferring the project of another organization will not influence our decision whether to accept your application.
* Anything else we should know about you?

### **We are Looking forward to work with you! Good Luck**
